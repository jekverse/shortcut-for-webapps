# WebApp Shortcut Creator 🚀

### For Linux Users Only! 🐧

Welcome to **WebApp Shortcut Creator**, your one-stop solution for turning your favorite web apps (like YouTube, Gmail, or even that random cat video site you keep visiting) into easily accessible shortcuts in your Linux menu. No more typing URLs over and over – because, let's face it, we're all too lazy for that! 😄

## What’s This For? 🤔
This repository is **exclusively for Linux users** (sorry, Windows and macOS folks!) who want to create shortcuts for web apps that show up in your application menu. Now, you can launch your favorite websites right from the menu, like they’re proper desktop apps. Fancy, huh?

## How to Use It? 🛠️
It's **super easy** to use. Just follow these three simple steps:

1. **Clone the repo** (like every GitHub project ever):
    ```bash
    gh repo clone 
    git clone https://github.com/jekverse/shortcut-for-webapps.git
    ```

2. **Enter the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd shortcut-for-webapps.git
    ```

3. **Run the setup script**:
    ```bash
    sh setup.sh
    ```

That’s it! Now, you can create shortcuts by typing `create-sh` into your terminal. The script will guide you through the process of adding your favorite web apps to the Linux menu, faster than you can say "Where's my YouTube shortcut?"

## Thank You for Stopping By! 🙌
Thanks for checking out this repo! Hopefully, it saves you from having to open a browser every time you need to check your email, binge-watch YouTube, or… you know, get lost in the abyss of web apps.

Happy shortcutting! 😎
